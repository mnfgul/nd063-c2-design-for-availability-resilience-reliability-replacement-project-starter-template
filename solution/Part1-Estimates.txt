- Minimum Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for a single AZ outage
Our RDS instance is configured to use two subnet groups and as each subnet resides in different AZ, our system will be reachable even in case of an AZ outage. Indeed, this is the main benefit of having Multi-AZ configuration for RDS instances.

- Minimum Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for a single region outage
The answer for this depends on the region that will cause the problem. If the outage happens in "secondary" region where our Read-Replicate is in then we will have only performance issue and RTO would be 0. However, if outage happens is "active" region then RTO will be the time required for replica instance to be promoted as primary.

- Minimum Recovery Point Objective for a single AZ outage
In this case the system will not have any issue in terms of recovery point as Multi-AZ configuration allows system to reach copy of the data in other AZs when one of them is down. This means our system will not loose and data. 

- Minimum Recovery Point Objective for a single region outage
As discussed on RTO section, the outcome of this depends on the region that will go down. If the outage is in "active" region, the RPO would be the time required for replicate instance to be promoted as master and become functional. This means the ingested data during this time will be lost. If the outage is in "secondary" region, the RPO will not be an issue as all incoming data will be saved into master. It is important to note that this may put a heavy load on master as it may cause to data loose due to database related performance issues.
